# C++ Projects

- **exam-scheduler**  
  An exam scheduling system based on graph coloring. It assigns timeslots to courses such that no student has overlapping exams by modeling the problem as a conflict graph.

- **mini-compiler**  
  A simple compiler front-end that includes a lexical analyzer and recursive descent parser. It processes a basic programming language by tokenizing input and validating syntax.

- **tga-image-processor**  
  A C++ program for loading, manipulating, and saving TGA images. Supports basic pixel operations like invert, brighten, and darken on 24-bit and 32-bit TGA formats.
