# TGA Image Processor

This project is a simple command-line tool written in C++ to process uncompressed 24-bit TGA images. It can read and write TGA files and apply different pixel-based operations like multiply, subtract, overlay, screen, adding color channels, scaling channels, extracting single color channels, combining separate channels, and flipping images vertically.

It uses basic file I/O and pixel manipulation to perform these operations. The program takes input and output filenames along with the desired operation and optional arguments, then saves the resulting image.
